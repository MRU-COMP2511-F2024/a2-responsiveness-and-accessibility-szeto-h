# Web Accessibility

## Throug the manual and automated analaysis I can see that white letters on light blue background in navigation bar may not be enough colour contrast, as a result, color of the background and text is changed. Semantic errors were also corrected to ensure text to speech availability. Descriptive image alt text is edited to increase accessibility.
