# Web Accessibility

## Through the manual and automated analysis, I can see that white letters on a light blue background in the navigation bar may not be enough colour contrast. As a result, the colour of the background and text is changed. Semantic errors were also corrected to ensure text-to-speech availability. Descriptive image alt text is edited to increase understanding of what is in the image for those who cannot see the images.
## By making the accessibility changes to my website, I am allowing my website figure-ground more obvious and make different elements less similar for better differentiation. By adding alt text for images, I am applying the continuity principle, using images to help provide an example or increase understanding of the topic. By correcting semantic errors, I am applying the similarity and proximity principles to ensure information is properly grouped and organized, this also helps with continuity as it assists in information flow.
